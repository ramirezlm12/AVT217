      <p>"Good-day, Little Red Riding Hood," said he.</p>

          <p>"Thank you kindly, wolf."</p>

          <p>"Whither away so early, Little Red Riding Hood?"</p>

          <p>"To my grandmother's."</p>

         <p>"What have you got in your apron?"</p>

        <p>  "Cake and wine. Yesterday was baking-day, so poor sick grandmother is to have
         something good, to make her stronger."</p>

        <p> "Where does your grandmother live, Little Red Riding Hood?"</p>
        <p>  "A good quarter of a league farther on in the wood. Her house stands under the 
        three large oak-trees, the nut-trees are just below. You surely must know it," replied Little Red Riding Hood.</p>
